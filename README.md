# Website-Shmebsite

Source code for my personal blog-sandbox-thing of a website.

This current version was made with [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), a blueprint for static sites running with Jekyll. Read more about Jekyll Now below, and check out the linked tutorial for a great guide on getting started.

# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

There's a more detailed walkthrough, [**Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages**](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) over at the Smashing Magazine website. Check it out if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough and some background on Jekyll. :metal:

It covers:

- A more detailed walkthrough of setting up your Jekyll blog
- Common issues that you might encounter while using Jekyll
- Importing from Wordpress, using your own domain name, and blogging in your favorite editor
