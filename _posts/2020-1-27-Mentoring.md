title: What does it mean to be a mentor?
---

So first things first, I think it's important to get some definitions across. When I say that I'm "mentoring" someone, I don't mean that I have some protégé following me around with a clipboard, finding wisdom in everything that I do.

That'd make for a pretty inefficient arrangement, considering how frequently I do something colossally stupid.

Instead, I mean that I dedicate a few hours each week to sync up with someone new to the field in order to offer support. This can manifest in a lot of different ways: sometimes I'm looking through their code reviews, sometimes I'm just giving advice, and sometimes they just want to ask a question or two. I make sure to warn them when I'm not confident about my answers, but the deal is that I am always willing to give an answer if they ask.

I believe that this part of the exchange is important. I am not infallible `[citation needed]`, and I try to make that clear whenever I'm in a position of authority. I'm well into the [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect on a lot of topics, and I make an effort to avoid giving out definitive answers when I have no idea what I'm talking about.

However, if my mentees **ask** me to answer based on my experience, make an educated guess, or just take a random shot in the dark on something, they know that they will receive **an** answer. It may not be the right one (a lot of the time I'm not even close), but they always have access to my best attempt.

There are a few things that I'm trying to accomplish with this policy. And since we're working in Markdown right now, we've got ourselves the following bulleted list:
- To make sure that I keep myself open to conversation about any topic they might want to discuss.
- To keep my mentees from ever feeling like they're asking too many questions.
- To keep **myself** accustomed to admitting when I don't know anything about a subject.

There's more to mentoring than just being open for feedback, because *of course there friggin' is*. This just scratches the surface of it. Hell, I barely **know** the surface of it (what else would you expect from an armchair psychologist on the internet?), and I've been making a legitimate effort to learn about it for a few years now. There are some other fun lessons like:
- How do I show my mentee how to solve a problem without just telling them the answer?
- What should I do if I think my mentee is doing something wrong?
- When is it okay to ask my mentee for feedback on how I'm doing? (Okay, that's enough bulleted lists for now)

Figure it out

That's right. Mentoring is hard, and I don't know the answers. In fact, I'm willing to bet that nobody's answer works perfectly. It's going to be a long time before I feel confident in my ability to navigate situations like that without constantly feeling like I'm just improvising, and probably longer still before I know how to teach that to someone else. But if you really want to what half-baked opinions some amateur can cook up about stuff like this...

Then I'll give it my best shot.
