### My name is Jake.

My first significant coding project was written in 2009. Hilariously, it was a game for the Windows Mobile operating system, as I had no ability to gague when a platform was in the process of dying out. Microsoft had already begun switching their efforts to the Windows Phone family, and my project now exists solely on an ancient HTC Touch in the desk drawer I reserve for items of sentimental value. Regardless of its short existence, the feeling I got when that game first booted on my phone was enough to cement my dreams of becoming a software developer.

Since then, I've managed to progress and learn quite a bit as a programmer [citation needed]. I gained experience developing in a few more languages, on a few more platforms, and I collected some neat tricks for solving the problems encountered along the way. I won't claim to have reached any semblance of mastery yet (this IS the first time I've built a website from the ground up, after all), but I've progressed to the point where going after a problem outside of my comfort-zone is no longer nerve-wracking. There's still quite a bit for me to learn, and I still try to finish each project as a better developer than when I started. However, I've managed enough experience that I can be an asset almost anywhere.
