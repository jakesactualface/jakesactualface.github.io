I'm a software engineer, and I teach programming on the side. Mentoring new developers is a new hobby that I've been lucky enough to acquire, and I'm delusional enough to think that some of these experiences would be entertaining to read about.

Most of my coding effort has gone toward furthering my career. You won't find many projects online with my name on them, and those that you **can** seek out are probably old enough to be embarrassing. Legacies are hard to build, so I'm leaving that as a problem for Future-Jake.

For now, I'd like to focus on helping engineers who are just starting out. If you're picking up your first project and have no idea where to start, I've got your back. If you're suffering from imposter syndrome at work, you're in the right place. And if you're just clicking around on the internet, looking for something vaguely inspirational to brighten up your day, feel free to stick around.

This one's for you guys.
